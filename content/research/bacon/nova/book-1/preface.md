<!-- EDITED BY JOSEPH DEVEY, M.A. -->
<!-- TRUE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF NATURE -->


Those who have dogmatized on nature <!-- , as on some well investigated subject, either --> from self-conceit or arrogance <!-- , and in the professorial style, --> have inflicted the greatest injury on philosophy and learning. 
- They have stifled and interrupted inquiry exactly in proportion as they have prevailed in bringing others to their opinion.
- Their own activity has not counterbalanced the mischief they have occasioned by corrupting and destroying that of others. 


On the other hand, those who think on the contrary are not contemptible. 
- These assert that nothing can be known
- They either:
  - hate the ancient sophists 
  - have unsure minds or
  - had an exuberance of learning
- They however, have not derived their opinion from true sources
- Their zeal was excessive

<!-- , and, hurried on by their zeal and some affectation, have certainly exceeded due moderation. But the more --> The ancient Greeks were more prudent, being <!-- b (whose writings have perished), held a more prudent mean, --> between:
- the arrogance of dogmatism, and
- the despair of skepticism

<!-- ; and though too frequently intermingling complaints and indignation[6] at the difficulty of inquiry, and the obscurity of things, and champing, as it were, the bit, have still persisted in pressing their point, and pursuing their intercourse with nature; thinking, as it seems, that the better method was not to dispute upon the very point of the possibility of anything being known, but to put it to the test of experience.  -->

Yet they <!-- themselves, by only employing the power of the understanding, --> have not adopted a fixed rule.
- Instead, they put importance on:
  - <!-- but have laid their whole stress upon --> intense meditation, and
  - a continual exercise and perpetual agitation of the mind.

Our method is difficult, but easily explained. 
- It consists in determining the degrees of certainty, while we restore the senses to their former rank. 
- We reject that operation of the mind which follows near the senses. 
- We open and establish a new course for the mind from the first actual perceptions of the senses themselves. 

This was the view of those who have assigned so much to logic.
- They sought some support for the mind
- They suspected its natural and spontaneous mode of action. 

The mind has come prepossessed with corrupted doctrines in daily life filled with the vainest idols.
- Such a technique of logic can no longer be used, as it came too late. 
<!-- But this is now employed too late as a remedy, when all is clearly lost, and after the mind, by the daily habit and intercourse of life, ha -->

The art of logic therefore does not remedy [7] the matter. 
- It has really just confirmed errors instead of  disclosing the truth.

Our only remaining hope is to begin the whole labor of the mind again. 
- We should not leave it to itself.
- Instead, we direct it perpetually from the very first, and attain our end like by mechanical aid. 

If men had attempted mechanical labors with their hands alone, without the aid of instruments, they would not be able to do much even if they used all their strength. 

<!-- as they have not hesitated to carry on the labors of their understanding with the unaided efforts of their mind, they would have been able to move and overcome but little, though they had exerted their utmost and united powers. -->

And just to pause awhile on this comparison, and look into it as a mirror; let us ask, if any obelisk of a remarkable size were perchance required to be moved, for the purpose of gracing a triumph or any similar pageant, and men were to attempt it with their bare hands, would not any sober spectator avow it to be an act of the greatest madness?

If they should increase the number of workmen, and imagine that they could thus succeed, would he not think so still more? But if they chose to make a selection, and to remove the weak, and only employ the strong and vigorous, thinking by this means, at any rate, to achieve their object, would he not say that they were more fondly deranged? 

If  they were to determine on consulting the athletic art, and were to give orders for all to appear with their hands, arms, and muscles regularly oiled and prepared, would he not exclaim that they were taking pains to rave by method and design? 

Yet men are hurried on with the same senseless energy and useless combination in intellectual matters, as long as they expect great results either from the number and agreement, or the excellence and acuteness of their wits; or even[8] strengthen their minds with logic, which may be considered as an athletic preparation, but yet do not desist (if we rightly consider the matter) from applying their own understandings merely with all this zeal and effort. While nothing is more clear, than that in every great work executed by the hand of man without machines or implements, it is impossible for the strength of individuals to be increased, or for that of the multitude to combine.

Having premised so much, we lay down two points on which we would admonish mankind, lest they should fail to see or to observe them. The first of these is, that it is our good fortune (as we consider it), for the sake of extinguishing and removing contradiction and irritation of mind, to leave the honor and reverence due to the ancients untouched and undiminished, so that we can perform our intended work, and yet enjoy the benefit of our respectful moderation. 

If we should profess to offer something better than the ancients, and yet should pursue the same course as they have done, we could never, by any artifice, contrive to avoid the imputation of having engaged in a contest or rivalry as to our respective wits, excellences, or talents; which, though neither inadmissible nor new (for why should we not blame and point out anything that is imperfectly discovered or laid down by them, of our own right, a right common to all?), yet however just and allowable, would perhaps be scarcely an equal match, on account of the disproportion of our strength. 

But since our present plan leads up to open an entirely different course to the understanding, and one unattempted and unknown to them, the case is altered. There is an end to party zeal, and we only take upon ourselves the character of a guide, which requires a moderate share of authority and good fortune,[9] rather than talents and excellence. The first admonition relates to persons, the next to things.

We make no attempt to disturb the system of philosophy that now prevails, or any other which may or will exist, either more correct or more complete. For we deny not that the received system of philosophy, and others of a similar nature, encourage discussion, embellish harangues, are employed, and are of service in the duties of the professor, and the affairs of civil life. Nay, we openly express and declare that the philosophy we offer will not be very useful in such respects. It is not obvious, nor to be understood in a cursory view, nor does it flatter the mind in its preconceived notions, nor will it descend to the level of the generality of mankind unless by its advantages and effects.

Let there exist then (and may it be of advantage to both), two sources, and two distributions of learning, and in like manner two tribes, and as it were kindred families of contemplators or philosophers, without any hostility or alienation between them; but rather allied and united by mutual assistance. Let there be in short one method of cultivating the sciences, and another of discovering them. 

And as for those who prefer and more readily receive the former, on account of their haste or from motives arising from their ordinary life, or because they are unable from weakness of mind to comprehend and embrace the other (which must necessarily be the case with by far the greater number), let us wish that they may prosper as they desire in their undertaking, and attain what they pursue. 

But if any individual desire, and is anxious not merely to adhere to, and make use of present discoveries, but to penetrate still further, and not to overcome his adversaries in disputes, but nature by labor, not in short to give elegant[10] and specious opinions, but to know to a certainty and demonstration, let him, as a true son of science (if such be his wish), join with us; that when he has left the antechambers of nature trodden by the multitude, an entrance may at last be discovered to her inner apartments.

And in order to be better understood, and to render our meaning more familiar by assigning determinate names, we have accustomed ourselves to call the one method the anticipation of the mind, and the other the interpretation of nature.

We have still one request left. We have at least reflected and taken pains in order to render our propositions not only true, but of easy and familiar access to men’s minds, however wonderfully prepossessed and limited. Yet it is but just that we should obtain this favor from mankind (especially in so great a restoration of learning and the sciences), that whosoever may be desirous of forming any determination upon an opinion of this our work either from his own perceptions, or the crowd of authorities, or the forms of demonstrations, he will not expect to be able to do so in a cursory manner, and while attending to other matters; 

but in order to have a thorough knowledge of the subject, will himself by degrees attempt the course which we describe and maintain; will be accustomed to the subtilty of things which is manifested by experience; and will correct the depraved and deeply rooted habits of his mind by a seasonable, and, as it were, just hesitation: and then, finally (if he will), use his judgment when he has begun to be master of himself.

<!-- FOOTNOTE
[1] Because it was idle to draw a logical conclusion from false principles, error being propagated as much by false premises, which logic does not pretend to examine, as by illegitimate inference. Hence, as Bacon says further on, men being easily led to confound legitimate inference with truth, were confirmed in their errors by the very subtilty of their genius.—Ed.
