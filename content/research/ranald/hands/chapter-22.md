SPECIALIZATION is greater efficiency, man the keynote of present-day vocations. For
has subdivided even the physical labor of roadbuilding or the manufacture of an automobile into many
processes with special machinery and special operators assigned to
each. As for the sciences and humanities, our fund of knowledge is
adding to itself such detail that one man is expected to master only
a small fraction of the tremendous whole. Physicians have divided
the body into tens of little bits, and doctors are ear specialists, eye
specialists, abdominal surgeons, dermatologists.

I do not want to take too unreal an attitude about our ability to
pick and choose our life's work. I fully realize that poverty and lack
of education, the necessity to go to work very young and all such
very real circumstances interfere with our freedom to become all
we are capable of being. Certainly, a person planning his future will
need to consider the trends in modern industry and professions and
not choose a certain type of work which has been superseded by newer
methods. Certainly he will have to figure on the labor market, the
supply of trained persons in relation to the abundance or scarcity
of jobs in a particular field. Yet, to the extent that self-knowledge

To begin with, let us classify the vocations, though I shall make
no attempt to be all-inclusive in my list. There are certain occupa-

While the length of the fingers will give some indication of the
method of working and thinking natural to a man, the
fingertips will greatly modify that preliminary finding. It is a safe
assumption to assign sensitivity and intuition to pointed and taper-
ing tips, practically to square ones, and energy to spready ones.

different lengths will be

I think, however, that I can permit myself one generalization in
connection with the various shapes of fingertips. Persons who have
many dealings with others, whose success is dependent on their
judgment of others and on tact and intuition, such as interviewers in
employment agencies, head waiters, actors, teachers, claim adjusters,
salesmen, contact

Those whose work is
and whose relations with coworkers are more or less
impersonal can safely have squarish fingertips. Those who must
dominate others have spatulate tips.
From the tips and fingers, we can form a rough picture of the
kinds of work for which a man is fitted. Of course, to divide voca-
tions by rigid lines is both incorrect and misleading. A mining en-
gineer, assigned to supervise a new development in unexplored moun-
tain regions, will require method and precision to make assays, to
figure engineering problems. He will need tact, ingenuity, under-
standing and authority to deal with a strange people. He should have

daring and physical energy and endurance. His hand would have to
be a mixed hand, yet with certain traits outstanding.
The writer, the lawyer, the public speaker, the preacher, the news-
paper reporter, the salesman, the auctioneer, the canvasser, the inter-
preter, the translator, need strong development of the Mercury
finger.
This finger governs verbal
facility,
whether of the spoken or
written word. Yet an easy flow of words by no means makes either
the great author or the great speaker; nor even the successful and
aggressive salesman. Each occupation requires other gifts besides.
For each of these professions there is no one ideal combination of
handmarkings, representing combinations of talents; there are many.
And for almost every hand there is more than one fitting avenue of
expression. Your hand will not so much tell you the one and only
way by which you may succeed and be happy as indicate the paths by
which you cannot, and also, show you a number by which you might.
As illustration, I should like to describe a number of hands of per-
sons who have found the work in which they could be satisfied. The

The hand of a friend of mine, a prominent engineer, is squarely
