The prodigious increase of the Netherlanders in their domestic and foreign trade, riches, and multitude of shipping, is the envy of the present, and may be the wonder of future generations.

Yet it is obvious how they have advanced themselves. This can be copied by other nations. 

 <!-- are , and in a great measure imitable by most other nations, but more easily by us of this kingdom of England, which I shall endeavour to demonstrate in the following discourse. -->

Some of the said means by which they have advanced their trade, and 
thereby improved their estates, are these following,

1. Their greatest councils of state and war have trading-merchants as members. 

These have:
- lived abroad
- both the theoretical knowledge and practical experience of trade

They suggest laws and peace treaties which benefit their own trade.

2. Their law of gavel-kind, 1 whereby all their children possess
an equal share of their fathers estates after their decease, and so are not
. 

<!-- [ Johnson’s Dictionary reports that the custom is in force in various parts of En-
gland, but especially in Kent. See Silas Taylor, The History of Gavel-kind (London: John
Starkey, ; repr. ).] -->

left to wrestle with the world in their youth, with inconsiderable assistance of fortune, as most of our youngest sons of gentlemen in England
are, who are bound apprentices to merchants.

3. Their exact making of all their native commodities, and packing of their herring, codﬁsh, and all other commodities, which they send abroad in great quantities; 

This makes their commodities reputable abroad. The buyers accept of them by the marks, without opening. 

Whereas the ﬁsh which our English make in Newfoundland and New-England, and herrings at
Yarmouth, often prove false and deceitfully made; and our pilchards 2 from the west-country false packed seldom contain the quantity for
which the hogsheads are marked in which they are packed.

And in England the attempts which our forefathers made for regulat-
ing of manufactures, when left to the execution of some particular per-
son, in a short time resolved but into a tax upon the commodity, without
respect to the goodness of it; as most notoriously appears in the business
of the , 3 which doubtless our predecessors intended for a scru-
tiny into the goodness of the commodity; and to that purpose a seal was
invented, as a signal that the commodity was made according to the
statutes, which seals, it is said, may now be bought by thousands, and put
upon what the buyers please.


4. Their giving great encouragement and immunities to the inventors of new manufactures, and the discoverers of any new mysteries
in trade, and to those that shall bring the commodities of other nations
ﬁrst in use and practice amongst them; for which the author never goes
without his due reward allowed him at the public charge.

5. Their contriving and building of great ships to sail with small charge, not above one third of what we are at, for ships of the same bur-
then in England; and compelling their said ships, being of small force to
sail always in ﬂeets, to which in all time of danger they allow convoy.

Sixthly, Their parsimonious and thrifty living, which is so extraordinary,

that a merchant of one hundred thousand pounds estate with them, will
scarce expend so much per cent. as one of ﬁfteen hundred pounds estate in
London.
Seventhly, The education of their children, as well daughters as sons;
all which, be they of never so great quality or estate, they always take care
to bring up to write perfect good hands, and to have the full knowledge
and use of arithmetic and merchants accounts; the well understanding
and practice of which, does strangely infuse into most that are the own-
ers of that quality, of either sex, not only an ability for commerce of all
kinds, but a strong aptitude, love, and delight in it; and in regard the
women are as knowing therein as the men, it does encourage their hus-
bands to hold on their trades to their dying days, knowing the capacity
of their wives to get in their estates, and carry on their trades after their
deaths: whereas if a merchant in England arrive at any considerable es-
tate, he commonly withdraws his estate from trade, before he comes near
the conﬁnes of old age; reckoning that if God should call him out of the
world, while the main of his estate is engaged abroad in trade, he must
lose one third of it, through the unexperience and unaptness of his wife
to such aﬀairs; and so it usually falls out.
Besides, it has been observed in the nature of arithmetic, that like
other parts of the mathematics, it does not only improve the rational fac-
ulties, but inclines those that are expert in it to thriftiness and good hus-
bandry, and prevents both husbands and wives in some measure in run-
ning out of their estates, when they have it always in their heads what
their expences do amount to, and how soon by that course their ruin
must overtake them.
Eightly, The lowness of their customs, and the height of their excise,
which is certainly the most equal and indiﬀerent tax in the world, and
least prejudicial to any people, as might be made appear, were it the sub-
ject of this discourse.
Ninthly, The careful providing for, and employment of their poor,
which it is easy to demonstrate can never be done in England compara-
tively to what it is with them, while it is left to the care of every parish to
look after their own only.
Tenthly, Their use of banks, which are of so immense advantage to
them, that some not without good grounds have estimated the proﬁt ofA New Discourse

them to the public, to amount to at least one million of pounds sterling
per annum.
Eleventhly, Their toleration of diﬀerent opinions in matters of reli-
gion: by reason of which many industrious people of other countries, that
dissent from the established government of their churches, resort to
them with their families and estates, and after a few years co-habitation
with them, become of the same common interest.
Twelfthly, Their law-merchant, by which all controversies between
merchants and tradesmen are decided in three or four days time, and that
not at the fortieth part, I might say in many cases not the hundredth part,
of the charge they are with us.
Thirteenthly, The law that is in use among them for transferring of
bills for debt from one man to another: this is of extraordinary advantage
to them in their commerce; by means of which, they can turn their stocks
twice or thrice in trade, for once that we can in England; because having
sold our foreign goods here, we cannot buy again to advantage, till we are
possest of our money; which perhaps, we shall be six, nine, or twelve
months in recovering: and if what we sell be considerable, it is a good
man’s work all the year to be following vintners and shopkeepers for
money, whereas, were the law for transferring bills in practice with us, we
could presently after sale of our goods, dispose of our bills, and close up
our accounts, to do which, the advantage, ease, and accommodations it
would be to trade, is so great, that none but merchants who have lived
where that custom is in use, can value to its due proportion.
Fourteenthly, Their keeping up public registers of all lands and
houses, sold or mortgaged, whereby many chargeable law-suits are pre-
vented, and the securities of lands and houses rendred indeed, such as we
commonly call, real securities.
Lastly, The lowness of interest of money, with them, which in peace-
able times exceeds not three per cent. per annum; and is now during this
war with England, 4 not above four per cent. at most.
Some more particulars might be added, and those aforesaid further
improved, were it my purpose to discourse at large of trade, but most of
the former particulars are observed and granted by all men that make it
. [I.e., the Second Anglo-Dutch War, –.]
 
any part of their business to inspect the true nature and principles of
trade; but the last is not so much as taken notice of by the most inge-
nious, to be any cause of the great increase of the riches and commerce
of that people.
I shall therefore in this paper conﬁne myself to write principally my
observations touching that, viz.
The proﬁt that people have received, and any other may receive, by re-
ducing the interest of money to a very low rate.
This, in my poor opinion, is the   of all the other
causes of the riches of that people; and that if interest of money were
with us reduced to the same rate it is with them, it would in a short time
render us as rich and considerable in trade as they now are, and conse-
quently be of greater damage to them, and advantage to us, than can
happen by the issue of this present war, though the success of it should
be as good as we could wish, except it end in their total ruin and extir-
pation.
To illustrate this, let us impartially search our books, and enquire in
what the state and condition of this kingdom was, as to trade and riches,
before any law concerning the interest of money was made: the ﬁrst of
which that I can ﬁnd, was anno . and we shall be informed that the
trade in England then was inconsiderable, and the merchants very mean
and few: and that afterwards, viz. anno . within ten years after inter-
est was brought down to eight per cent. there were more merchants to be
found upon the exchange worth each one thousand pounds and upward,
than were in the formers days, viz. before the year . to be found
worth one hundred pounds each.
And now since interest has been for about twenty years at six per cent.
notwithstanding our long civil wars, and the great complaints of the
deadness of trade, there are more men to be found upon the exchange
now worth ten thousand pounds estates, than were then of one thousand
pounds.
And if this be doubted, let us ask the aged, whether ﬁve hundred
pounds portion with a daughter sixty years ago, were not esteemed a
larger portion than two thousand pounds now: and whether gentle-
women in those days would not esteem themselves well cloathed in a
serge gown, which a chamber-maid now will be ashamed to be seen in:A New Discourse

whether our citizens and middle sort of gentry now are not more rich in
cloaths, plate, jewels, and houshold goods, &c. than the best sort of
knights and gentry were in those days. And whether our best sort of
knights and gentry now do not exceed by much in those things the no-
bility of England sixty years past: many of whom then would not go to
the price of a whole satten doublet; the embroiderer being yet living, who
has assured me he has made many hundreds of them for the nobility with
canvas backs.
Which way ever we take our measures, to me it seems evident, that since
our ﬁrst abatement of interest, the riches and splendor of this kingdom
is increased to above four, I might say above six, times so much as it was.
We have now almost one hundred coaches for one we had formerly,
we with ease can pay a greater tax now in one year, than our fore-fathers
could in twenty.
Our customs are very much improved, I believe above the proportion
aforesaid, of six to one; which is not so much in advance of the rates of
goods, as by increase of the bulk of trade; for though some foreign com-
modities are advanced, others of our native commodities and manufac-
tures are considerably abated, by the last book of rates.
I can myself remember since there were not in London used so many
wharfs or keys for the landing of merchants goods, by at least one third
part as now there are; and those that were then, could scarce have em-
ployment for half what they could do; and now notwithstanding one
third more used to the same purpose, they are all too little in a time of
peace, to land the goods at, which come to London.
If we look into the country, we shall ﬁnd lands as much improved since
the abatement of interest, as trade, &c. in cities; that now yielding
twenty years purchase, which then would not have sold for above eight
or ten at most.
Besides, the rent of farms have been for these last thirty years much
advanced; and altho’ they have for these three or four last years fallen,
that has no respect at all to the lowness of interest at present, nor to the
other mistaken reasons which are commonly assigned for it.
But principally to the vast improvement of Ireland, since a great part
of it was lately possessed by the industrious English, who were soldiers
in the late army, and the late great land taxes.
 
More might be said, but the premises being considered, I judge will
suﬃciently demonstrate how greatly this kingdom of England has been
advanced in all respects for these last ﬁfty years: and that the abatement
of interest has been the cause of it, to me seems most probable; because
as it appears, it has been in England, so I ﬁnd it is at this day in all Eu-
rope and other parts of the world; insomuch that to know whether any
country be rich or poor, or in what proportion it is so, no other question
needs to be resolved, but this, viz. what interest do they pay for money?
Near home we see it evidently, in Scotland and Ireland, where ten and
twelve per cent. is paid for interest; the people are poor and despicable,
their persons ill clothed, their houses worse provided, and money intol-
erable scarce, notwithstanding they have great plenty of all provisions,
nor will their land yield above eight or ten years purchase at most.
In France where money is at seven per cent. their lands will yield about
eighteen years purchase; and the gentry who possess lands, live in good
condition, tho’ the peasants are little better than slaves, because they can
possess nothing but at the will of others.
In Italy money will not yield above three per cent. to be let out upon
real security; there the people are rich, full of trade, well attired, and their
lands will sell at thirty ﬁve to forty years purchase; and that it is so, or bet-
ter with them in Holland, is too manifest.
In Spain the usual interest is ten and twelve per cent. and there,
notwithstanding they have the only trade in the world for gold and sil-
ver, money is no where more scarce; the people poor, despicable, and
void of commerce, other than such as the English, Dutch, Italians, Jews,
and other foreigners bring to them; who are to them in eﬀect, but as
leeches, who suck their blood and vital spirits from them.
I might urge many other instances of this nature, not only out of
Christendom, but from under the Turks dominions, East-India and
America: but every man by his experience in foreign countries, may eas-
ily inform himself, whether this rule does universally hold true or not: for
my part, to satisfy my own curiosity, I have for some years, as occasion
oﬀered, diligently enquired of all my acquaintance that had knowledge
of foreign countries, and I can truly say that I never found it to fail in any
particular instance.
Now if upon what has been said, it be granted that de facto, this king-A New Discourse

dom is richer at least four-fold, I might say eight fold, than it was before
any law for interest was made, and that all countries are at this day richer
or poorer in an exact proportion to what they pay, and have usually paid
for the interest of money; it remains that we enquire carefully, whether
the abatement of interest be in truth the cause of the riches of any coun-
try, or only the concomitant or eﬀect of the riches of a country; in which
seems to lie the intricacy of this question.
To satisfy myself in which, I have taken all opportunities to discourse
this point with the most ingenious men I had the honour to be known
to, and have searched for, and read all the books that I could ever hear
were printed against the abatement of interest, and seriously considered
all the arguments and objections used by them against it; all which have
tended to conﬁrm me in this opinion, which I humbly oﬀer to the con-
sideration of wiser heads, viz. that the abatement of interest is the cause
of the prosperity and riches of any nation, and that the bringing down of
interest in this kingdom from  to , or  per cent. will necessarily, in less
than twenty years time, double the capital stock of the nation.
The most material objections I have met with against it are as follows:
Object. . To abate interest, will cause the Dutch and other people that
have money put out at interest in England, by their friends and factors,
to call home their estates, and consequently will occasion a great scarcity
and want of money amongst us.
To this I answer, that if interest be brought to  per cent. no Dutch-
man will call in his money that is out upon good security in England, be-
cause he cannot make above  per cent. of it upon interest at home. But
if they should call home all the money they have with us at interest, it
would be better for us than if they did it not; for the borrower is always
a slave to the lender, and shall be sure to be always kept poor, while the
other is fat and full: he that uses a stock that is none of his own, being
forced for the upholding his reputation to live to the full, if not above the
proportion of what he does so use, while the lender possessing much, and
using little or none, lives only at the charge of what he uses, and not of
what he has.
Besides, if with this law for abatement of interest, a law for transfer-
ring bills of debt should pass, we should not miss the Dutch money, were
it ten times as much as it is amongst us; for such a law will certainly
 
supply the defect of at least one half of all the ready money we have in
use in the nation.
Object. . If interest be abated, land must rise in purchase, and conse-
quently rents; and if rents, then the fruits of the land; and so all things
will be dear, and how shall the poor live? &c.
Ans. To this I say, if it follow that the fruits of our land, in consequence
of such a law for abatement of interest, grow generally dear, it is an evi-
dent demonstration that our people grow richer; for generally, where-
ever provisions are for continuance of years dear in any country, the
people are rich; and where they are most cheap throughout the world, for
the most part the people are very poor.
And for our own poor in England, it is observed, that they live better
in the dearest countries for provisions, than in the cheapest, and better
in a dear year than in a cheap, especially in relation to the public good,
for in a cheap year they will not work above two days in a week; their hu-
mour being such, that they will not provide for a hard time, but just work
so much and no more, as may maintain them in that mean condition to
which they have been accustomed.
Object. . If interest be abated, usurers will call in their money; so
what shall gentlemen do, whose estates are mortgaged? &c.
Answ. I answer, that when they know they can make no more of their
money by taking out of one, and putting it into another hand, they will not
be so forward as they threaten, to alter that security they know is good, for
another that may be bad: or if they should do it, our laws are not so severe,
but that gentlemen may take time to dispose of part of their land, which
immediately after such a law will yield them thirty years purchase at
least; and much better it is for them so to do, than to abide longer under
that consuming plague of usury, which has insensibly destroyed very
many of the best families in England, as well of our nobility as gentry.
Object. . As interest is now at  per cent. the king’s majesty upon any
emergency can hardly be supplied; and if it should be reduced to  per
cent. how shall the king ﬁnd a considerable sum of money to be lent him
by his people?
Answ. I answer, the abatement of interest to the people, is the abate-
ment of interest to the king, when he has occasion to take up money; for
what is borrowed of the city of London, or other bodies politic, nothingA New Discourse

can be demanded but the legal interest; and if the king have occasion to
take up money of private persons, seeing his majesty, according to good
right, is above the common course of law, the king must, and always has
given more than the legal rate. As for instance; the legal rate is now  per
cent. but his majesty, or such as have disposed of his majesty’s exchequer-
tallies, have been said to give ten and twelve in some cases; and if the
legal rate were , his majesty might probably give  or ; so if interest
be brought to  per cent. his majesty in such cases as he now gives ,
must give but  or ; by which his majesty would have a clear advantage.
Object. . If interest be abated, it will be a great prejudice to widows
and orphans, who have not knowledge and abilities to improve their es-
tates otherwise.
Answ. I answer, that by our law now, heirs and orphans can recover no
interest from their parents executors, except it be left fully and absolutely
to the executors to dispose and put out money at the discretion of the ex-
ecutors, for the proﬁt and loss of the heirs and orphans; and if it be so left
to the executors discretion, they may improve the monies left them in
trade, or purchase of lands and leases, as well as by interest; or when not,
the damage such heirs and orphans will sustain in their minority, being
but two per cent. is inconsiderable, in respect of the great advantage that
will accrue to the nation in general, by such abatement of interest.
Besides, when such a law is made, and in use, all men will so take care
in their life to provide for and educate their children, and instruct their
wives, as that no prejudice can happen thereby, as we see there does not
in Holland and Italy, and other places where interest is so low.
Having now oﬀered my thoughts in answer to the aforesaid objec-
tions, it will not be amiss that we enquire who will be advantaged, and
who will receive prejudice, in case such a law be made.
First, his majesty, as has been said in answer to that objection, will,
when he has occasion, take up money on better terms. Besides which, he
will receive a great augmentation to his revenue thereby, all his lands be-
ing immediately worth, after the making such a law, double to what they
were before; his customs will be much increased by the increase of trade,
which must necessarily ensue from the making such a law.
The nobility and gentry, whose estates lie mostly in land, may
presently upon all they have, instead of ﬁfty write one hundred.
 
The merchants and tradesmen, who bear the heat and burthen of the
day, (most of our trade being carried on by young men that take up
money at interest) will ﬁnd their yoke sit lighter upon their shoulders,
and be encouraged to go on with greater alacrity in their business.
Our mariners, shipwrights, porters, clothiers, packers, and all sorts of
labouring people that depend on trade, will be more constantly and fully
employed.
Our farmers will sell the product of their lands at better rates. And
whereas our neighbours, the Netherlanders (who in regard of the large-
ness of their stocks and experiences, the sons continually succeeding the
fathers in trade to many generations, we may not unﬁtly in this case term
sons of Anach, and men of renown) 5 against whom we ﬁght dwarfs and
pigmies in stocks and experience, being younger brothers of gentlemen
that seldom have above one thousand pounds, sometimes not two hun-
dred to begin the world with: instead, I say, of such young men and small
stocks, if this law pass, we shall bring forth our Sampsons and Goliaths
in stocks, subtilty, and experience in trade to cope with our potent ad-
versaries on the other side, there being to every man’s knowledge that
understands the exchange of London, divers English merchants of large
estates, who have not much past their middle age, and yet have wholly
left oﬀ their trades, having found the sweetness of interest, which if that
should abate, must again set their hands to the plough, which they are as
able to hold and govern now as ever, and also will engage them to train
up their sons in the same way, because it will not be so easy to make them
country gentlemen as now it is, when lands sell at thirty or forty years
purchase.
For the suﬀerers by such a law, I know none but idle persons that live
at as little expence as labour, neither scattering by their expences, so as
the poor may glean any thing after them, nor working with their hands
or heads to bring either wax or honey to the common hive of the king-
dom; but swelling their own purses by the sweat of other mens brows,
and the contrivances of other mens brains. And how unproﬁtable it is for
any nation to suﬀer idleness to suck the breast of industry, needs no
demonstration. And if it be granted me, that these will be the eﬀects of
. [I.e., giants; cf. Numbers :.]A New Discourse

an abatement of interest, then I think it is out of doubt, that the abate-
ment of interest does tend to the enriching of a nation, and consequently
has been one great cause of the riches of the Dutch and Italians, and the
increase of the riches of our own kingdom in these last ﬁfty years.
Another argument to prove which, we may draw from the nature of
interest itself, which is of so prodigious a multiplying nature, that it must
of necessity make the lenders monstrous rich, if they live at any moder-
ate expence, and the borrowers extream poor; a memorable instance of
which we have in old Audley deceased, who did wisely observe, that one
hundred pounds only, put out at interest at  per cent. does in seventy
years, which is but the age of a man, increase to above one hundred thou-
sand pounds; and if the advantage be so great to the lender, the loss must
be greater to the borrower, who, as has been said, lives at a much larger
expence. And as it is between private persons, so between nation and na-
tion, that have communication one with another. For whether the sub-
jects of one nation lend money to subjects of another, or trade with them
for goods, the eﬀect is the same. As for example, a Dutch merchant that
has but four or ﬁve thousand pounds clear stock of his own, can easily
borrow and have credit for ﬁfteen thousand pounds more at  per cent.
at home; with which, whether he trade or put it to use in England, or any
country where interest of money is high, he must necessarily, without
very evil accidents attend him, in a very few years treble his own capital.
This discovers the true cause, why the sugar-bakers of Holland can
aﬀord to give a greater price for Barbadoes sugars in London, besides the
second freight and charges upon them between England and Holland,
and yet grow exceeding rich upon their trade; whereas our sugar-bakers
in London, that buy sugars here at their own doors, before such addi-
tional freight and charges come upon them, can scarce live upon their
callings; ours here paying for a good share of their stocks  per cent. and
few of them employ in their sugar works above six to ten thousand
pounds at most; whereas in Holland they employ twenty, thirty, to forty
thousand pounds stock in a sugar-house, paying but  per cent. at most
for what they take up at interest, to ﬁll up their said stocks, which is
sometimes half, sometimes three quarters of their whole stocks. And as
it is with this trade, the same rule holds throughout all other trades what-
soever. And for us to say, if the Dutch put their money to interest among
 
us, we shall have the advantage, by being full and ﬂush of coin at home,
it is a mere chimera, and so far from an advantage, that it is an extream
loss, rendring us only in the condition of a young gallant, that has newly
mortgaged his land, and with the money thereby raised, stuﬀs his pock-
ets, and looks big for a time, not considering that the draught of cordial
he hath received, though it be at present grateful to his palate, does in-
deed prey upon his vital spirits, and will in a short time render the whole
body of his estate in a deep consumption, if not wholly consumed. Be-
sides, whatever money the Dutch lend us, they always keep one end of
the chain at home in their own hands, by which they can pull back when
they please their lean kine, 6 which they send hither to be fatted.
This makes me conclude that Moses, that wise legislator, in his for-
bidding the Jews to lend money at use one to another, and permitting
them to lend their money to strangers, ordained that law as much to a po-
litical as a religious intent, knowing that by the latter they should enrich
their own nation, and by the former no public good could ensue. The
consequence being only to impoverish one Jew to make another rich.
This likewise takes oﬀ the wonder how the people of Israel, out of so
small a territory as they possessed, could upon all occasions set forth such
vast and numerous armies, almost incredible, as all histories, sacred and
prophane, report they did; which is neither impossible nor strange to any
that have well considered the eﬀects of their laws concerning usury,
which were suﬃcient to make any barren land fruitful, and a fruitful land
an entire garden, which by consequence would maintain ten times the
number of inhabitants that the same tract of land would do where no
such laws were.
To conclude, it is, I think, agreed on by all, that merchants, artiﬁcers,
farmers of land, and such as depend on them, which for brevity-sake we
may here include under one of these general terms, viz. seamen, ﬁsher-
men, breeders of cattle, gardiners, &c. are the three sorts of people who
by their study and labour do principally, if not only, bring in wealth to a
nation from abroad; other kinds of people, viz. nobility, gentry, lawyers,
physicians, scholars of all sorts, and shopkeepers, do only hand it from
one to another at home. And if abatement of interest, besides the general
. [Cows.]A New Discourse

beneﬁt it brings to all, except the griping dronish usurer, will add new life
and motion to those most proﬁtable engines of the kingdom, as I humbly
suppose, will be manifest upon serious consideration of what has been
said; then I think it will be out of doubt, that the abatement of interest is
the cause of the increase of the trade and riches of any kingdom.
