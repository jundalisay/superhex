{{< s v="4.155" >}} Why do the parts of the segments of the magnet, which were united before the section, also repel each other?

If a magnet is cut in a plane parallel to a line drawn through its poles, and the segment is freely suspended above the magnet from which it was cut, 

A magnet will spontaneously turn and assume the position opposite to that which it had before.

If the parts A and a were first joined, and likewise [&] B and b, afterwards b turns towards A, and a towards B: namely, because formerly the Southern part of one Southern part was joined to the other, and the Boreal Boreal, after the division the striated particles having gone out through the Southern part of the one, must enter through the Boreal of the other; and having gone out by the Boreal, enter by the South.


{{< s v="4.166" >}} Why are two points, which were formerly contiguous in one magnet, in its fragments poles of different virtues?

It is also evident why, if a magnet is divided by a plane, by cutting a line drawn through the poles at right angles, the poles of the segments, which before the section touched each other, as b and a, are of opposite virtue; they must enter through another.


{{< s v="4.157" >}} Why is it the same in some parts of a magnet as in the whole?

It is no less evident that the current is the same in any part of the magnet as in the whole: for this current is not different in the poles than in the other parts, but is only seen to be greater, because through them come out the striated particles which have passed through the longest paths of the magnet, and which are intermediate between all coming from the same side: at least in a spherical magnet, to the example of which /296/ in the rest the poles are considered to be there, where the greatest force appears. 

Nor is this force different in one pole than in another, except in so far as the striated particles, having entered through one, exit through another: and there is no so small a part of a magnet in which, if they have an entrance, they do not also have an exit.


{{< s v="4.158" >}} Why does he share his magnetism with the iron that is attached to him?

Nor is it surprising that iron, when moved by a magnet, acquires magnetic properties from it. For it already has passages suitable for receiving the striated particles, and it lacks nothing to acquire this fruit, except that the ends of some small branches, of which its ramifications are composed, protrude from one side to the other in these passages; all of which must be bent towards one and the same direction, in those passages through which the striated particles coming from the South can pass, and in the opposite direction in others. 

When the magnet is moved, the striated particles, in great force and in great abundance, like a torrent, rushing into the iron channels, bend these ends of the twigs in this manner; and therefore they themselves give all that was desired in him for the purpose of being magnetic.


{{< s v="4.159" >}} **Why does iron, for the various ways in which it is moved by a magnet, receive itself in many different ways?**

For the different parts of the magnet, to which the iron is applied, it receives this force in different ways. Thus, the part R of the iron RST, if applied to the Boreal pole of the magnet P, will become the South pole of the iron, because through it the striated particles coming from the South enter, and through the part T the Borealis, reflected from the `pole A` by the air. 

The same part `R`, if it lies above the equator of the magnet, and looks at its northern pole, as in C, will again become the southern pole of iron; but if it is inverted and looks at the South Pole, as in D, then it will lose the power of the South Pole and become the Borealis Pole.

Finally, if the middle part S of this iron touches the pole of the magnet A, the striated Borealis particles, having entered it through S, will go out on both sides through R and T, so that at each end it will receive the force of the South pole, and in the middle the force of the Boreal pole.


{{< s v="4.160" >}} **Why does not an oblong iron receive it, except according to its own length?**

It can only be asked why these striated particles, entering part S from the pole A of the iron magnet, do not proceed straight towards E, but rather are reflected from here towards R and T; and thus this iron receives magnetism according to its length, rather than according to its breadth. But the answer is easy, because they find much more open and easy ways in the iron than in the air, from which therefore the iron is reflected.

[4.161] Why does the magnate lose nothing of his wife, although he shares it with the sword?

It is also an easy answer, if it is asked why a magnet loses nothing of its ui when it shares it with steel. For no change takes place in the magnet, because the striated particles, coming out of it, enter the iron rather than any other body: except perhaps that, passing more freely through the iron than through other bodies, they also come out more abundantly from the magnet when the iron is attached to it; by which he is absent so much that his power is diminished, rather than increased. /298/

[4.162] Wherefore these things should be dealt with very quickly with iron, but be strengthened in it by the long course of time.

And in a very short time this water approaches the iron, because the striated particles flow very rapidly through it; but the long delay is confirmed in it, because the longer the ends of the branches remain bent in one direction, the more difficult they are bent in the opposite direction.
