A lot of people confuse socialism, left wing, democracy, and communism with each other. This is because ideas from one generation are commonly usurped by later generations according to their different experiences, rather than creating new names for new ideas arising from those new experiences.

![Phone and a Smartphone](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ni2rC5pbSjMiBLyOVEOIxQ.jpeg)

A modern day example is the mobile phone and smartphone. 

A mobile phone means mobile telephone. When computer-abilities were added to it, it became a ‘smartphone’, with 'smart' representing the computer-abilities. However, this name is wrong because the computer-ability outweighs the telephone-ability, which really is just voice calls. 

People use their ‘smartphones’ more for:
- watching movies
- playing games
- text-chatting
- live-streaming

These have much more weight than doing the simple voice calls allowed by telephones. Nowadays, smartphones are more properly called mobile devices.

David Hume explained that such naming mistakes are caused by the mind always choosing the mental processes that expend the least energy — it tries to connect ideas and form new ones without thinking. The phone became smart and so it was called a smartphone.

> Update Dec 2020: The recent term 'social distancing' is another example of wrong naming. It's used to imply keeping a physical distance from each other in order to prevent virus transmission. However, society is abstract in essence. Therefore, social distancing would mean being aloof, or not thinking about others at all. Two busy employees might physically bump into each other and not even mind nor remember the incident. Such a case would really be social distancing in the proper sense. The correct term for avoiding the virus is 'physical distancing'. The prevalence of 'social distancing' (and the fact that no one is denouncing it in favor of 'physical distancing') is proof that the essential science of Metaphysics or Dialectics is dead.


## Political Misnaming

In politics, this is commonly seen in the confusion between democracy and socialism.

Democracy first appeared in ancient Greece and was defined by Socrates* as a system where people could vote on everything. 

> *Another problem is the word 'oligarchy'. Socrates originally used it to mean rule through money. However, modern dictionaries wrongly define oligarchy as 'rule of the few'. But tyranny, timocracy, and aristocracy are all ruled by a few people, and so the dictionary defintion is useless. What the dictionary staff probably did was simply to use the literal meaning of oligarchy as ὀλίγος or 'the few', not knowing that Socrates only used it to differentiate it from 'demos' or 'the many'.

**Socialism** first appeared in the 19th century from the French economists Henri de Saint-Simon. It was as an alternative to the unregulated freedom after the French Revolution destroyed the controlling power of the monarchy and the church:

- The freed peasants made up the first estate
- The monarchs and the church made up the second estate
- The merchants* and manufacturers made up the third estate

> *After the French Revolution, the aristocrats were lumped into a term called 'capitalists' because of the industrial revolution. Our [other post](/social/economics/capitalism) explains why even the modern word 'capitalist' is wrong because it originally meant profit-earners, which include farmers and peddlers. Adam Smith never used the word 'capitalist'. The classical term for modern capitalism was "stock-jobbing" which emphasizes the growth of paper stock-price. Thus, Neo-classical Economics should be more accurately named as 'Paper Mercantilism' and Capitalism as 'Stock-Paper Mercantilism' as its subset.



Socialism meant the third estate unifying their interests with the first estate in order to keep factories running and industry humming. This led to the concept of employee wages and benefits for the first class coming from the third class. This is so common nowadays.  

Thus, the peasants were split into two:

1. The not-so-free socialized peasants who could get private property
  - These are the modern liberals
2. The free and unsocialized ones who also could get private property (i.e. working for themselves, not working in industry)
  - These are the modern libertarians

The problem then began when Marx and Engels hijacked the socialism concept and diverted it into Communism -- a class-less utopia where there is no freedom (rather, freedom is sacrificed in order to attain utopia). This led to the 3 branches:

1. The extremely-non-free socialists as Communists **who were not permitted to have private property**
2. The not-so-free socialists who could get private property
3. The free unsocialized peasants as anarchists who also could get private property, as the *petit bourgeoisie*

D’autres auteurs, à la suite de Marx et Engels notamment, ont également qualifié Saint-Simon de socialiste. Le recours à la centralisation est la raison la plus souvent invoquée pour justifier le socialisme de Saint-Simon.<br><br>Si l’on définit le socialisme par trois critères (propriété collective des moyens de production ; absence de concurrence ; planification rationnelle des activités économiques), alors Saint-Simon n’est pas socialiste car il respecte, formellement, la propriété privée et les droits privés qui y sont associés : les profits. Pour lui, l’égalité industrielle [consiste] (…) en ce que chacun retire de la société des bénéfices exactement proportionnés à sa mise sociale, c’est-à-dire à sa capacité positive, à l’emploi utile qu’il fait de ses moyens, parmi lesquels il faut comprendre, bien entendu, ses capitaux
<cite> Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon, l'industrialisme et les banquiers, Franck Yonnet 2004</cite>

<!-- and Sismondi as a system which valued workers and peasants. This is opposite of James and John Stuart Mill who valued the capital* owners. -->

<!-- Note that even this is wrong and was only corrected in 1919 with the invention of the word technocrats). -->

<!-- ![](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/screens/oligarchy.png) -->

This corruption of the word 'socialism', to mean not having private property, was continued by Lenin who was released by the Germans into Russia. This then established the corrupt version of socialism as the United Soviet Socialist Republic, which really should've been the United Soviet Communist Republic.

The USSR should've been the USCR.

![Socialism](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fg8t-4HacALpwTF7Kq050w.jpeg)

Because of Marx and Engels, socialism has since been defined to be the same as communism, very different from the socialism of the French Revolution. In reality the original socialism just means:
- wages and benefits
- coming to work on time
- having job titles and specializations
- etc.



But the Cold war is more recent than the French Revolution, so it would be naive to hope that everyone can go back to the original French definition.


## The Features of a Social Republic

As a workaround, we've created a new term called [social networkism](/social/social-networkism) to bring back the original French idea (social) <!-- with the addition of the new concept of the soul of society (dialectical) --> which can manifest as a social network (networkism). It distances itself from anarchism or laissez-faire liberalism by espousing the unity of society over the unity of the self*. 

> *Recall that, in our system, [a person has 3 billion selves](/medical/idea-of-self).


When systematized as a government, it becomes a 'social network republic' which we shorten to 'social republic'. Countries which adopt this system will then be named 'The Social Republic of Wakanda', for example. 

This idea remains true to Socrates' Republic and the French Revolution which defined socialism to be in-between anarchism and monarchy, while clearly having private property.

- 'Social' refers to the liberal or left-wing aspects or the democrat and oligarch that represents freedom
- 'Republican' refers to the conservative or right-wing aspects or the tyrants and aristocrats that represents control

![Social Republic](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fr-ac4humLAx8ocsYXBVQA.png)

Thus, a social republic unifies left and right wing into a single harmony* that alternates in leadership, while balancing personal freedom and state control.

> *Western universities shallowly interpret Socrates' musical advocacy as referring to audible music. In reality, his music refers to the symphony of feelings, whether of humans, animals, or the universe itself. This makes him consistent with the Asian philosophers who pushed for harmony with the Tao or dharma. 


The main features of a social republic are:

- Constitutional Virtues to unite the different political and economic ideologies
- A combination of money-economy and moneyless-economy
- The Fourth Branch of government as the Resources Branch
- Bicameral Federal Parliament following [David Hume's system](/research/hume/essays/part-2/16-the-ideal-system-of-government)


## The Ideology Matrix = Social Cycles + Spacetime

While this solves such a problem for this generation, future generations might hijack and usurp these repaired ideas and render them messed up as usual. To prevent this, we created an Ideology Matrix which classifies every socio-economic-political idea that can be possibly generated by the human mind.

It combines David Hume's work which explained the dynamics of the mind, with Socrates' cycles* of democracy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy that matches the four castes of Eastern shudras, ksatriyas, brahmins, and vaeshyas. By doing so, we:
- unify eastern and western metaphysics 
- show that both had the same core observations of human society and the human species, but using different terminologies


{{< me d="December 2021" >}}
We have now systematized this as the [Four Laws of Value](/social/economics/principles/four-laws-of-value)
{{< /me >}}

{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
The four governments are those of Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded. Oligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved. It is a form of government which teems with evils. Democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy, although very different. Lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst State.

{{< img src="/graphics/social/cycles.png" cap="In Social Superphysics, democracy is populist (shudra), tyranny is militant (ksattriya), aristocracy is philosophical (brahmin), and oligarchy is mercantile (vaesya). These then are caused by the Four Laws of Value which are the metaphysical counterparts of the physical Four Laws of Thermodynamics" alt="Social Cycles">}}
<!-- ![Varna dharma](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/varna.jpg) -->


It's a 3D matrix that classifies ideas based on three axes:

- Selfishness-nonselfishness (as a function of ego or the entity observing existence)
- Objectivism-nonobjectivism (as a function of the natural duality of existence, or physics vs metaphysics, within space-time)
- Social cycles (as a function of how the ego changes in duality in different space-times)

By plotting their core ideas in our matrix, it is easier to see how different Socialism is from Communism.

The ideas then progress in a cyclical way from democracy to oligarchy, then back to democracy. For example:

- the expansionist ideas of the tyrannical Mongol Yuan dynasty was overturned by the Ming dynasty
- the Ming started as aristocratic but turned oligarchic as it focused on trade and its Treasure fleet
- the Ming Hong Wu emperor was later overturned by the isolationist policy of the more-democratic Qing dynasty
- finally, it was overturned by Communist tyranny

In America, this can be seen in:

- the oligarchy created by George W. Bush which was overturned by the democracy of Obama
- the democracy of Obama was later overturned by the tyranny of Trump 

<!-- From this, we can say that the tyrannical stage of America and China differs in their objective-ness, with China striving for standardization via their social credit system, while Trump goes for more arbitrariness. -->

<!-- ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*58okvB3XEPK5ClzXm4rKCQ.jpeg) -->

 
The most sustainable political philosophies and economic systems are those that are near the center, which balance non-selfishness and objective-ness, while adapting to changes in the social cycles. 

In [Buddhism](/research/schumacher/buddhist-economics/part-1), this is called the Middle Way and is essential to sustainable happiness. 


In economics, this would be Capitalist systems having a bit of Socialism (as what the Nordic countries are doing), or Socialist systems having a bit of Capitalism (as what China is doing, though they seem to take the state capitalism side too far).

The word begins to be used in French in the modern sense c. 1835. Socialista, with a different sense, was applied 18c. to followers and pupils of Dutch jurist Grotius (1583-1645), from his use of socialistus. Socialist realism attested from 1934.

    Prison is a Socialist's Paradise, where equality prevails, everything is supplied and competition is eliminated. [Elbert Hubbard, "The Note Book," 1927]

Compare socialism.
social (adj.)

c. 1400, "devoted to or relating to home life;" 1560s as "living with others," from French social (14c.) and directly from Latin socialis "of companionship, of allies; united, living with others; of marriage, conjugal," from socius "companion, ally," probably originally "follower," from PIE *sokw-yo-, suffixed form of root *sekw- (1) "to follow." Compare Old English secg, Old Norse seggr "companion," which seem to have been formed on the same notion). Related: Socially.

Sense of "characterized by friendliness or geniality" is from 1660s. Meaning "living or liking to live with others; companionable, disposed to friendly intercourse" is from 1720s. Meaning "of or pertaining to society as a natural condition of human life" first attested 1695, in Locke. Sense of "pertaining to fashionable society" is from 1873.

Social climber is from 1893; social work is 1890; social worker 1886. Social drinking first attested 1807. Social studies as an inclusive term for history, geography, economics, etc., is attested from 1916. Social security "system of state support for needy citizens" is attested from 1907 (the Social Security Act was passed by U.S. Congress in 1935). Social butterfly is from 1867, in figurative reference to "flitting."

Social contract (1763) is from translations of Rousseau. Social Darwinism attested from 1887. Social engineering attested from 1899. Social science is from 1785. In late 19c. newspapers, social evil is "prostitution." Social network is attested by 1971; social networking by 1984; social media by 2008. Social justice is attested by 1718.

    I must introduce a parenthetical protest against the abuse of the current term 'social justice'. From meaning 'justice in relations between groups or classes' it may slip into meaning a particular assumption as to what these relations should be; and a course of action might be supported because it represented the aim of 'social justice', which from the point of view of 'justice' was not just. The term 'social justice' is in danger of losing its rational content—which would be replaced by a powerful emotional charge. I believe that I have used the term myself: it should never be employed unless the user is prepared to define clearly what social justice means to him, and why he thinks it just. [T.S. Eliot, footnote in "Notes Towards the Definition of Culture," 1948]

-ism 
word-forming element making nouns implying a practice, system, doctrine, etc., from French -isme or directly from Latin -isma, -ismus (source also of Italian, Spanish -ismo, Dutch, German -ismus), from Greek -ismos, noun ending signifying the practice or teaching of a thing, from the stem of verbs in -izein, a verb-forming element denoting the doing of the noun or adjective to which it is attached. For distinction of use, see -ity. The related Greek suffix -isma(t)- affects some forms.

## Essential to Social Superphysics

The ideology matrix is an essential part of Social Superphysics as it will help advance beliefs and ideologies that are near the center, yet flexible enough to fit the current cycle of the country where it will be implemented. This will make it global yet local at the same time. It is implemented as one of the features of ISAIAH Match which is our machine learning platform.
