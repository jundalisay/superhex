## The Original Dialectics, Based on the Nature of Things

The Dialectics of Socrates, or David Hume's science of man, is a system of analysis based on the invisible metaphysical True Nature or Dharma or Tao* of anything that exists in reality.

Problems begin when something does not keep in line with its nature. For example:
- loading a pickup truck with 2 tons when it was only designed for 1 ton will cause problems
- eating too much too fast will lead to stomach problems
- installing an app that requires 2GB RAM on a device with only 1GB RAM will lead to errors

Superphysics aims to solve real-world problems by:
- finding the true nature, dharma, or tao of the elemens of the problem
- tracing the events or circumstances that caused those elements to veer off of its nature  
- suggest ways to get back to that 'natural' or proper state


![Socrates' profile](/covers/socrates.jpg)

> *Dharma is the passive version. The Tao is the active 'flowing' version. Both have reference to metaphysical causes or the Supreme Entity. Lowercase dharma and tao are the ordinary version in nature. Similarly, 'True Nature' is anchored in something Divine and invisible, while 'nature' is what is ordinarily inherent.  



Socrates calls this Dharma or Tao as the first principle or True Nature of anything that exists in the physical domain (observable by the five senses). This Dharma, Tao, or True Nature itself resides in the invisible metaphysical domain of ideas and feelings. 

You cannot see your ideas and feelings. Instead, you can make them 'real' in the physical domain by expressing them physically:
- speaking
- drawing
- acting out 
- writing, etc  


{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
<p>Dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle. It is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure. By her gentle aid, she lifts up the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough. She uses as handmaids and helpers the sciences in the work of conversion. Custom calls them sciences. But they should have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science. We called this "understanding".</p>
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato Book 7, Chapter 4</cite>

### Built to Solve Problems

Unlike spiritual theories which are often useless, Socratic Dialectics is meant to solve real world problems. This makes it more in line with science and technology than philosophy. 

{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
The Pythagoreans who have enquired about harmony as are wrong as the astronomers.
They investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard. But they never apply them to problems. They never reach the natural harmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.. Their pursuit will be valuable for our objects if all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and connection with one another and become considered in their mutual affinities. Until then, there is no profit in pursuing them.
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato Book 7, Chapter 4</cite>

## Science and Math versus Socratic Dialectics and Data Science

Current science is totally based on the physical perceptions of things that already exist. This makes it the opposite of metaphysics which is totally based on invisible perceptions as ideas and feelings.  


{{< q a="smith" >}}
Archyta invented the Categories. He may be regarded as the founder of ancient Dialectics.<br><br>The opinions of Empedocles coincide with those of Aristotle. Empedocles authored the doctrine of the Four Elements. He may be regarded as the founder of [its rival] ancient Physics*.
<cite>Simplified Origin of Philosophy, Adam Smith</cite>
{{< /q >}}


> *Superphysics marries the invisible metaphysics of Archyta with the visible physics of Empedocles.


Science uses math to plot the patterns of its  physical perceptions. From those patterns, it tries to work back to the cause.

The problem here is that **all causes are metaphysical in nature, since all causes are based on ideas and feelings**

- Terrorism is caused by the angry feelings of the terrorist and the idea to use bombs to express his anger
- Supertyphoons are caused by the feelings of heat by the planet <!-- ideas of thermodynamics leading to the compound idea of --> as global warming
- Covid is caused by the idea of coronaviruses which are felt as symptoms of coughing, fever, loss of taste, etc. Before science, epidemics were thought to be caused by evil spirits of unknown cause. Both science and non-science are ignorant* of the root cause of such viruses and evil spirits. 

> *Superphysics places the root cause of such viruses or spirits as [coming from stars](/articles/medical/covid-flu-star), just like all matter comes from supernovae (star explosion)


Math, on the other hand, is confined to physical perceptions. The best that math and science can do is to speculate on the causes of problems based on the pattern of effects. It's like a blind man groping in the dark to discover where he is or what's around him. 

For example, science knows that global warming is caused by greenhouse gas emissions. But it is helpless in actually solving those emissions which is rooted in the love for the causes of emissions -- eating meat, using electricity and oil, clearing ugly forests to build beautiful real estate, etc. 


{{< img src="/graphics/science.jpg" alt="Science versus Dialectics" cap="Science uses Math to drill down to an answer. Superphysics uses Dialectics first to think out of the box and gather all ideas about the nature of the problem and then uses math and logic, as data science, to drill down to the best answer" >}}



{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
Surely the skilled mathematician is not a dialectician.
<cite>Socrates, The Republic Book 7</cite>
{{< /q >}}



### The Dialectical Upgrade

Dialectics is an upgrade of current science as it not only find patterns in physical perceptions and facts, but also in metaphysical perceptions as the feelings, opinions, and interpretation of the facts by other minds*.


> *Recall that we [divided reality into the physical and metaphysical domains](/articles/superphysics/we-are-in-a-matrix). Physical things exist in the former, while metaphysical things, such as ideas and feelings, exist in the latter. Metaphysics is the cause, physics is the effect. The soul is the cause, brain activity is the effect. The chakras are the cause, the hormones are the effect.


Science only deals with the interpetation of a dataset. But Dialectics deals with **all possible interpetations** of a dataset. By getting all the data, as well as all the interpretations of the data, then total knowledge is achieved. 


{{< img src="/graphics/socdialectics.jpg" alt="Socratic dialectics" cap="The Dialectics of Aristotle is merely based on a thesis. The Dialectics of Socrates is based on the True Nature of a thing as it was designed by the Supreme" >}}


But not all data is useful, just as not all interpretations are valid. To solve this, Socratic Dialectics uses wise minds to churn, project, then weed out the bad data and interpretations to preserve only the good and solid ones. Such minds have a more solid grasp of both metaphysics and physics or science and have no bias. 

Socrates does this churning process as the Socratic method wherein a wise mind takes an idea from a theorist and then walks forward with the theorist's mind towards the projected effect of his idea, or backwards in order to discover the cause together.

The natural contradiction between the metaphysical and physical dimensions then manifest as the "contradictions" which Hegel emphasized. 


{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
<p>A person will find himself at the top of the intellectual world when he tries to discover the absolute by the light of reason only [via intution], without the help of the senses, and perseveres by pure intelligence until perceives the absolute good [dharma or tao]. This is the same as the sight that has seen the visible. This progress is called dialectic.</p>
<cite>The Simplified Republic by Plato</cite>
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="parm" >}}
<p>Yes but I think that you should go a step further, and <i>consider not only the consequences which flow from a given hypothesis, but also the consequences which flow from denying the hypothesis.</i></p>
<cite>The Simplified Parmenides by Plato</cite>
{{< /q >}}


Nowadays, this manifests as peer reviews where new theories and interpretations are filtered out by senior academics* who are supposed to have a better grasp of principles.  

> *In contrast to scientific peer reviews where the academic is a master of material principles, dialectical peer reviews are done by senior metaphysicians (dialecticians) who have a solid grasp of both Eastern and Western metaphysics. Unlike the academic who is verified by a man-made PhD, the seniority of a dialectician is verified by his track record of predicting things correctly (ideas matching reality). For example, he can predict that a policy on mask-wearing will be accepted by City A but rejected by City B. 



Inferior theorists, such as Kant, would likely be filtered out by such minds*. This explains why Kant attacked Dialectics: 


{{< q a="kant" >}}
<p>Dialectics is a logic of illusion. It is a sophistical art for giving ignorance and intentional sophistries.. it teaches us nothing regarding the content of our cognitions. It merely shows the formal conditions of their accordance with the understanding, which do not relate to and are quite indifferent in respect of objects. Any attempt to employ it as a tool to extend our knowledge must end in mere nonsense since anyone can oppose any assertion.</p>
<cite>Part 2, Introduction, Simple Critique of Pure Reason</cite>
{{< /q >}}


> *For example, the collapse of the USSR clearly shows that the ideas of Marx and Lenin were wrong. Thus, they can never be regarded as Socratic dialecticians. On the other hand, the ideas of The Prophet Mohammad, Jesus, and Buddha have persisted and flourished. These prove that they are in line with the True Nature of things. 



The distillation of the total knowledge then leads to a single pattern knowledge from cause to effect which then are called principles or understanding. A product of the distillation of the knowledge* of Western and Eastern philosophy then produces universal and timeless principles which we call The Metaphysics of Things or MoT.
<!-- https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Juan_Dalisay_Jr_The_Metaphysics_of_Things_Book_1?id=JY3tDwAAQBAJ -->

MoT then becomes the foundation of Superphysics. Unlike metaphysical principles which are purely theoretical, MoT must survive in physical reality, either as actual evidence, demonstrations, or successful predictions. 

{{< me date="December 2021" >}}
Examples of real-world evidence are:
- Bio Superphysics: the success of traditional Chinese medicine against Covid, relative to their total lack in the West
- Economic Superphysics: the prediction of the crisis years starting in 2019 onwards, relative to a prediction of a recovery in 2021 from pent-up demand and vaccine success
- Social Superphysics: the low cases of mass shootings, conflict, and revolutions in Asia, relative to the Americas and Africa
- Material Superphysics: the prediction that fusion will not work because artificial gravity has not been discovered yet

### The German Corruption of Dialectics 

The Germans were good at math and so they corrupted dialectics into a system that deals with effects and not with the cause. Instead of focusing on the metaphysical aspects of dialectics, Hegel focused on the churning of data which he represented with historical events. 

Engels and Marx then fully corrupted this idea by saying that the churning was caused by physical conditions as materialism. A better churn would result if the material conditions were mastered. The dialectical materialism of Marx resulted in evil, suffering, and death, which are the opposite of what the dialectics of Socrates aimed for.

Since then, the metaphysical and dharmic nature of Socratic dialetics have been forgotten. Dialectics nowadays refers to Hegel's dialectics that do not have any metaphysics nor even any mysticism*.


> *The Republic clearly talks about reincarnation and chakras in [the Story of Er](/research/socrates/simple-republic/book-10/chapter-3). This adds to our dialectical dataset which also includes those from Hinduism and Buddhism. These then lead to principles in Bio Superphysics that mirror Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine, and Homeopathy



{{< img alt="Kant and Marx" src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/kantmarxcrop.jpg" >}}

<!-- 
 totally different from the corrupted German dialectics espoused by Hegel, Engels, and Marx. Socrates' dialectics is purely metaphysical and so the German "dialect materialism" is an inherent contradiction similar to "good evil". 
 -->

Materialism, from both the German and British philosophers of the 19th century, extinguished the Enlightenment and led to World Wars, Communist Revolution, and the spread of profit maximization from Modern Economics which caused the 1929 crash and many financial crises.

These problems exist until today as terrorism, inequality, and global warming disasters, all because the same materialistic root from Hegel's time was never removed. Materialistic science will not be able to solve the problems created by materialism. Only Socratic dialetics, with its metaphysical base, can go out of the box and see the problem with new eyes. 



## The Re-Enlightenment

If the scientific revolution upgraded the natural philosopher into a scientist, then the dialectical revolution will upgrade the scientist into a superscientist (or dialectical scientist), with the upgrade representing a 'level-up' in human understanding. 

This upgrade manifests as the huge amounts of data and information absorbed and processed by the dialectician from all sources anywhere in the world in all of human history which the scientist neglects or refuses. For example, scientists refuse to regard myths and metaphysical works as information. They immediately refuse ideas from Ayurveda, Feng Shui, Reiki, souls, aliens, other dimensions, etc.

<!-- / Dialectics is based on 
/ b universal principles 
/ | which we call 
/ i The Metaphysics of Things. 
/ You could think of modern science as a lower class of study, limited to the five senses (particularly vision), and Superphysics as a higher class of study that adds the senses of feeling and intuition. The objects are the same, but the paradigm is expanded and new tools are added. -->
  
Dialectics is unbiased and so it can take this mass of ideas to be churned in order to extract common patterns that can lead to more solid principles. For example, it takes the observations on the levitation of Buddhist monks and the zipping of UFOs to add new possibilities of movement and propulsion to benefit space travel. These observations are then put into the black box of dialectical principles we called The Metaphysics of Things (MoT) in order to [create new ones](/solutions/material/how-to-fix-general-relativity/). 

This system of collecting all possible data and then churning them with MoT in order to come up with solutions is then called **Superphysics**. The trigger for the original dialectics of Socrates was the prevalence of writing and literature among the Greeks. The trigger for Superphysics is the internet and all the content loaded in it. 

<!-- This method takes the best principles from Western and Eastern philosophy to come up with universal ones as [The Metaphysics of Things or MoT](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JY3tDwAAQBAJ). MoT is the set of underlying principles that Superphysics works with, as an implementation of Socratic Dialectics. Eastern philosophy provides the overall truths and principles, while Western philosophy gives their specifics, creating philosophical teamwork to solve any problem that science cannot solve.  -->

<!-- Science cannot solve things absolutely because it relies on evidence, which is the effect. This is why it always lags and is behind the curve. 

Dialectics, on the other hand, is based on truths which is the cause, and can go ahead of the curve via predictions. A scientist only knows science, but a dialectician must know not only science AND metaphysics, but also the science and metaphysics of the West AND the East. 
 -->
In the evolution of human understanding, Superphysics is the next and last stage after science.

### How We Apply Socratic Dialectics

We use the Socratic dialectical approach and the scientific approach to solve Covid symptoms:

| Scientific Approach | Dialectical Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Note down the symptoms | 1. Note down the symptoms |
| 2. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Western Medicine | 2. Test the drugs or treatmens suggested by Western Medicine |
|  | 3. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Naturopathy |
|  | 4. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Ayurveda |
|  | 5. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Traditional Chinese Medicine |
|  | 6. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Homeopathy |
|  | 7. Know the principles of each medical paradigm and find patterns to find out which paradigm deals best with Covid 19  |

<p>the science of harmony, is a laborious study and this is why we should learn it. It will tell us whether there are any other applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight of our own higher object.</p>

<cite>The Simple Republic, Book 7, Chapter 4</cite>

<!-- ### Tougher than Aristotlean Dialectics -->

Notice how the Socratic dialectical approach is more laborious and lengthy than the scientific approach. This is evident in Socratic dialogues which are made very long by the dialectician expounding on every minor topic in order to reveal its true nature, which will in turn reveal the true nature of the bigger picture.


This laborious method produces a huge dataset that is similar to the "table of existence and presence" described by Francis Bacon:

{{< q a="Bacon" >}}
The investigation of forms proceeds thus from a given nature, we first present to the understanding all the known instances which agree in the same nature, even if the subject matter is considerably diversified. This collection must be made as a mere history, without any premature reflection.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Bacon" >}}
For instance, take the investigation of the form of heat. Instances agreeing in the Form of Heat:
<br>
1. The rays of the sun, particularly in summer, and at noon.
<br>
2. The same reflected and condensed, as between mountains, or along walls, and particularly in burning mirrors.
<br>
3. Ignited meteors.
<br>
4. Burning lightning.
<br>
5. Eruptions of flames from the cavities of mountains, etc.
<br>
6. Flame of every kind.
<br>
...
<br>
28. Other instances.
<br>
This is a <b>table of existence and presence</b>
{{< /q >}}

From this table we can apply machine learning algorithms in order to extract new ideas which will then lead into a new table. That new table will then lead to new ideas which will form a new table and so on. 

This collection of tables, when constantly compared with new perceptions, will lead to a dynamic thinking process which we call **Artificial Sentience**. This is different from Aritifical Intelligence which is limited to a closed set of data. 

To explain artificial sentience, we must explain artificial intelligence first. This will be done in the next chapter.
