We know the existence of thing through our perceptions of it. Each perception has two aspects:
- physical
- metaphysical

For example, when we see a mug, we have both the physical perception of a mug and a metaphysical idea of a mug nearly at the same time.

## The Two Domains

This means that the mug exists in two domains of reality:

1. The physical mug exists in the physical domain, which we see and touch. 
  - This mug is made of glass.

2. The metaphysical mug exists in the metaphysical domain, as our idea of what a mug is. 
  - This mug-idea is made of aether.
  - Unlike the physical mug which we can see and touch, this aethereal mug-idea can only be perceived by our abstract minds.


{{< q a="Bacon" >}}
Let the investigation of forms, which are eternal and immutable, constitute metaphysics. 

Let the investigation of the efficient cause of matter, constitute physics. 
<cite>Francis Bacon, Nova Organum, Book 2</cite>
{{< /q >}}


<!-- Parallel to these, let there be 2 practical divisions; to physics that of mechanics, and to metaphysics that of magic, in the purest sense of the term, as applied to its ample means, and its command over nature. -->



### The Physical Domain

This domain exists only because of our physical senses, most commonly by our sight and touch which are really 'electromagnetic' types of perception. 

- Our senses let us perceive the mug physically by receiving the light and touch-sensations that **bounce back to them**. 
- Invisible and intangible objects are those that **do not let light nor touch-senations bounce back**. 
  - An example is the air which lets light pass through and offer no resistance to our hands.  


{{< q a="Bacon" >}}
Humans should learn the difference between the idols of the human mind and the ideas of the divine mind. The former are mere arbitrary abstractions. The latter are the true marks of the Creator on his creatures, as they are imprinted on, and defined in matter, by true and exquisite touches. 
<br><br>
Truth and utility, therefore, are here perfectly identical. The effects are more valueable as pledges of truth rather than as practical benefits
<cite>Francis Bacon, Nova Organum</cite>
{{< /q >}}


### The Metaphysical Domain

This domain exists only because we have abstract minds which have an innate ability to 'house' or have ideas and thoughts.

- We are able to conceive an idea, or think of a thought, **if it bounces back in our minds onto our consciousness**.
- We are unable to have an idea or thought if it does not bounce back to our consciousness.

An example of a metaphysical object that doesn't bounce back is when we forget a thought, such as the password to an email account. We know that it was in our minds in the past, but our consciousness couldn't 'find' it because the effort that the mind exerts in remembering it doesn't bounce back with the actual password. 

It would be like querying a database without the query returning anything.

Another example is a problem that we have no solution for, such as:
- how to increase sales that are declining, or
- how to make a device work. 

In such cases, we think about the solution by:
- brainstorming, or
- tinkering with the device

Even then, the solution might still not reflect to our consciousness. 

The solution might finally reflect after we:
- ask our customers directly, or
- read the device's user manual. 

At that moment, our minds feel a relief since its effort can end.

Aĺl men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses which are useful and loved for themselves. The most important is the sense of sight. We prefer seeing over the other senses.  
<cite>The Metaphysics by Aristotle Simplifed, Book 1, Chapter 1</cite>
{{< /q >}}


The metaphysical domain exists inside our abstract minds and is infinitely larger and richer than physical domain of our senses. 

<!-- This matches the common opinion that the physical universe is much larger than what we can currently perceive. We can say that the unknown parts are part of the metaphysical domain until they are actually perceived physically.  -->

{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
If Person A were to go from the lower to the middle region, he would imagine that he is going up. Person B is in the middle region but has never seen the true upper world. He sees Person A coming and imagines that he has arrived in the upper region. 
If Person A goes back down, Person B would imagine that he was descending. This would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions.
<cite>The Republic by Plato Simplifed, Book 9, Chapter 3</cite>

We call this domain "aethereal" or made of aether or *akasha* in Hinduism. This will be explained later when we explain our Five Layer Model. 


{{< q >}}
These causes generate an inequality which is always maintained, and is continually creating a perpetual motion of the elements... The brightest part is called the aether. The most turbid sort is mist and darkness.
<cite>Timaeus Simplifed</cite>

These 3 regions of metaphysical domain, physical domain, and current perception (as a merger of both) are expressed in our Superphysics icon.

{{< img src="/icons/sp.png" size="is-48x48" alt="Superphysics icon">}}

- The blue upward triangle reprsents the metaphysical domain going upwards
- The green downward triangle represents the physical domain going 'down to earth'
- The yellow circle represents the focus of the mind as the here and now, as a combination of both. 

The balance of the triangles represents the balance between the abstract and the concrete. We can't focus on useless theory all the time. Nor can we go around doing physical actions without thinking of their causes and effects. 

Inaction leads to nothing. But haste, on the contrary, also makes waste. 

Human minds have limited abilities and so our focus must be relevant in order to maximize and concentrate what little we have. For example, as a species, it would be better to focus on solutions to global warming than to think of how to make more money, create a new cryptocurrency, or predict the stock market. The latter ideas are really based on selfish-interest instead of the common-interest.

The next chapter will explain the nature of ideas, which are the main objects in the metaphysical domain.
