## Society

'Society' comes from the Latin socius which means companion which is an abstract term. 


## Nation

'Nation' comes from the Latin natus which refers to birth. Thus, a nation can have two meaning:

1. The place where a person was born -- this leads to nationality 
2. The ethnicity of the person at birth -- this leads to 'Cherokee nation' if one's parents are both Cherokee
 

## State

A state is a formalized society that is non-arbitrary. 

Its opposites are kingdoms, tribes, and nations, which are arbitrary. 

Unlike a nation that has physical attributes such as a place of birth and race of parents, a state is an abstract idea. 

A state has derivative ideas:
- A nation-state is a collection of tribes that has evolved to govern itself. 
- A city-state is a city that has defined its society. 

A state can merge with other states and become a United States or European Union, or split up like former Soviet states. The next evolution is the global state.
