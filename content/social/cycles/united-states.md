<!-- Real America vs Liberal America

The American founding fathers put God as the ruler over freedom (liberalism), as proven by "In God We Trust."

Bible Belt states as the Real America. However, the  Civil war north against the South non-liberal south which preferred slavery. 

This led to God being replaced by liberalism and therefore ambition, money, and property. This led to expansionism as the Spanish-Ameican War and then entry into WWI and WWII. It will likely see-saw between liberalism (financial crisis, globalism) and noniberalism (anti-vaxxer, racism) around every 200 years or so.      -->
