The radiant layer is the third layer in the universe. It manifests as energies that spread out in space at the speed limit of spacetime (known to physics as the speed of light). 

It manifests as light, magnetism, and electricity.

In terms of creation, this layer is the third layer that spreads across the space created by the spacetime layer.

Unlike the spacetime layer that has a very large space of influence, this layer has a limited space to influence, which manifests as 'fields'. The error of physicists is in extending this field dynamics upwards onto the spacetime layer, as Quantum fields. 

This leads to absurd concepts like singularity, which is a physical location that defies the laws of physicality.
