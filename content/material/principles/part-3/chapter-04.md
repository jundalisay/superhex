Physics is based on a materialistic interpretation of reality, which is opposite of the metaphysical interpretation by Superphysics. 

For example, physics prefers to view things as particles. This is consistent with the atomic model of Democritus and opposite of the musical model of Pythagoras. 
- The atomic model was embraced by Newton and Einstein
- The musical model was embraced by Socrates and Kepler

We continue this musical paradigm by using waves instead of particles. This is consistent with sound waves which manifest as the mantras which are so important to Hinduism and Buddhism.  

A necessary consequence of thinking in particles is the creation of the concept of spin. This is referred to as the intrinsic angular momentum of particles in spacetime. This has two inherent qualities:

1. Magnitude

- Force-particles have a spin magnitude of 1 (via polarization)
- Matter-particles have a spin of 1/2 (via magnetic fields)
- Elements have a nuclear spin from 1/2 onwards, depending on the sum of its spins

2. Direction

- A particle can either be right-handed or left-handed
- Particles of the same charge must have opposite-handed spins while those of different charges can have the same-handed spins per energy level

The spin of a particle is determined only after it goes through detectors which impose an energy on those particles. This imposition causes the particle to react and respond with its own interpretation of the magnitude and direction of that energy based on the nature of that partcile. Thus:
- force-particles react with a spin of 1
- matter-particles react with a spin of 1/2
- elements react with a spin from 1/2 onwards

We can therefore equate the idea of spin to the ability of particles to mirror the qualities of the detectors or **reflect the energies imposed on them**. We will call it more properly as "binary reflectivity*" instead of spin. A particle will react with an up or down reflectivity to a detector that measures an up or down direction, and a right or left one to a detector that measures a right or left direction.

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/argonspin.jpg" alt="Argon Spin" cap="Spin is the inherent ability of particles to mirror the forces or actions done on them. In double slit experiments, the detector influences the particle, causing changes in the interference pattern. In quantum eraser experiments, the particles react differently depending on whether they are erased or not. “Erased” photons merely change locations or quantum-teleport depending the outcome for the entangled partner, and do not undergo retrocausality." >}}


## So What's the Use of Binary Reflectivity of Particles?

This property of reality explains how mentality creates reality -- because reality really just reflects the mind of the existing entity. 

This is not so easy to prove because there are many instances when our mentality creates a reality opposite from our desires. However, this is not the fault of Nature, but of the mind not acting to its dharma, tao, or true nature. This causes it to sabotage itself. 

In theory, this principle of the electromagnetic layer can be used:

- to improve chemical transformations and reactions by making elements reflect better properties that are in the location. This explains why the crops from one region taste better than those from another, despite using the same seeds and fertilizers. In theory, the good properties of Location A can be sent electromagnetically to Location B
- for light-based computing where photons are entangled in liquid crystals as to be able to process more information than electricity-based computers
- for the teleportation of vehicles. In theory, the spins of all of a ship's particles in Location A can be switched to that of Location B to teleport it 

<!-- Entangled particles change their spin instantly to match the detector or the observer, "collapsing" into reality. It also gives an illusion of  retrocausality, when in fact it just shows non-locality. This non-locality is then the foundation of teleportation. -->


<!-- We convert these into waves:

1. Frequency

Instead of magnitude, we use wave frequency so that:

- Force-waves have a frequency of 1 (via polarization)
- Matter-waves have a frequency of 1/2 (via magnetic fields)
- Element-waves have a nuclear frequency from 1/2 onwards, depending on the sum of its frequency

2. Directional Purpose as unifying or divisive

- A wave can either be unifying (positive) or divisive (negative)
- Waves of the same direction (unifying and unifying) must have opposite frequencies.
  - An example is a classical music being made up of different instruments. 
  - Another example is a family made up of husband and wife. 
- Waves of different directions (unifying and dividing) can have the same frequency per energy level. 
  - An example is a classical guitar and an electric guitar. 
  - Another example is a husband Mr. Smith and another husband Mr. Jones.

The next post, explains the five layers of the universe, of which only four are known by Physics.
