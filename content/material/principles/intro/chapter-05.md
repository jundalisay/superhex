## The Two Domains

In [the previous post](/material/solutions/cartesian-view), we explained the Cartesian view which saw the universe in two planes: 

1. Physical
2. Aethereal 

These two planes have two attributes as timespan and layer, and lead to two kinds of sources of motion:

1. Physical Force
2. Aetheral Effort 

The motion is then represented by the Kepler tensor made up of:

- G or the Gravitational Signature of the Identity
- s or the layer where that identity is moving, set by the Cartesian View

## The Five Layers of Superphysics

Superphysics has five layers derived from the ancients. In the physical plane, these lead to five kinds of gravities and five kinds of relativities:

Physical Layer| Gravity | Relativity or Bands | Pythagorean Tone | Independence of Time
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Aethereal Gravity (Higgs Field) | Aethereal | La | Insignificant
Spatial | Gravity | Gravitational | Sol
Radiant | Magnetism |  Radiant (Special Relativity) | Mi | Dependent on Viewpoint
Transformative | Radioactivity (Weak force) | Feynman Diagrams | Re | 
Material | Atomic bond (Strong force) | Material | Do | Totally Absolute or Independent of Viewpoint


In the metaphysical plane, this leads to five groups of motions for layers which roughly follow Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Metaphysical Layer | Need | Examples
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Spiritual | Enlightenment and Realization
Spatial | Psycho-spritual, Intellectual | Philosophy (Movement of Ideas), Theories
Radiant | Expression, Mental | Religion (Movement of Beliefs), Mental Diseases
Transformative | Social | Marriage, Elections, Complex Diseases
Material | Bodily | Price Movements, Procedures, Ordinary Diseases

In this way, the Kepler tensor can trace and predict all movements in the universe. 



## Has Relativity Baked In

According to both Kepler and Descartes, all movement is relative to something.
- To Kepler, the movement of planets are relative to the sun and to each other
- To Descartes, all movement of an object is relative to itself at the former time
