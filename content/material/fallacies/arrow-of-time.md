The Arrow of Time Problem has already been resolved a long time ago by Parmenides, again by Avicenna, and again by Descartes, Hume, and Hegel. 

The problem is that science keeps on unsolving it because of the 'factual' nature of science itself. 


## Only the Now is Real

The solution is that only current perceptions are real. 

{{< q a="Parmenides" >}}
If the One is absolutely without participation in time, it never had become, or was becoming, or was at any time, or is now become or is becoming, or is, or will become, or will have become, or will be, hereafter
{{< /q >}}


It means past and future perceptions are equally fake. 

A past memory becomes real after it is recalled by the mind as a current perception. 

- For example, if I remember that I ate bread yesterday, then it becomes real if I can actually recall that memory. If I cannot recall that memory (put the past as a current perception) then that memory is fake. 

Likewise, a future speculation becomes real after it matches current perception.  

- If I predict that an earthquake will happen tomorrow, then it becomes reality if I actually perceive an earthquake on that day as a current perception. If not, then that prediction was fake.  

So if I travel back in time and see my young self, then that young self is real because it is a current perception. But it is not me since I can still perceive myself. Conservation law does not allow 2 entities when 1 will do.

Therefore, my young self is another identity. Killing him has the same effect as me killing any other entity that is not me (non-suicide). So there is no grandfather paradox. 

That paradox only seems to exist because **the mind sees the whole event from a linear point of view of time, assigning reality to past, present, and future.** This makes it assign a single identity to the present me and past me. 

This linear point of view is in turn a necessary consequence of observing phenomena in isolation in a third person perspective. In our 5-layer paradigm, it only arises because aethereal mind of the 5th layer is put under the spacetime layer, which is the 4th layer.  


## Science ALways Unsolves the Problem

Such a perspective necessarily abandons the current perception of the identities in the phenomenon and assigns a reality to past and future (i.e it makes predictions from the phenomena -- this comes from the tendency of the mind to connect things).  

This is exactly what the scientific method does, each time it makes experiments and records data -- giving past data a reality while hoping for a reality for its future predictions. 

And so science itself unsolves what has been solved. 

The Asian sciences of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism avoids this by keeping not attached to the illusions of the past and future. 

Hinduism takes this to the extreme by renouncing them so that it can experience past, present, and future as one unit as mukti or moksha. 

To avoid unsolving things, we bring back Descartes' physics which always accounts for the illusion and reality, as the mind-body problem, something that Newtonian physics doesn't have. 

Instead of basing time on entropy of space, Descartes' physics bases time on the unity of perceptions. 

Instead of order and disorder, time is based on unity and disunity.  

This will allow time to be mastered so that time travel can be done and predictions will be more accurate, as a new breed of time-technologies which are a different class from electromagnetic technologies (TV, radio, internet, smartphones).
