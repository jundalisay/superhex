In his book Relativity, Einstein says that the changing of the place of a star observed during the 1919 eclipse is due to spacetime being curved around the sun. 

He then uses this as proof that spacetime is a flexible fabric that constrains all motions. This led pepole to believe that it would create immense amounts of energy to travel at the speed of light or even to travel through time. 
  
Hawking then builds on this to create arbitrary and useless spacetime theories. This also led to the wild goose chase for dark matter and dark energy that are supposed to be within this spacetime fabric.

In reality, the 1919 eclipse is not a proof of General Relativity. Instead, it proved that Descartes' third rule is correct -- that curved motion happens when two object influence each other, and straight motion happens when there is no influence.

The curving of the photon around the sun is the sun's effort to force the photon into an orbit around it. The photon travels too fast and so only a curve arises instead of an orbit. 

The 1919 eclipse thus proves that Descartes was correct, along with his theory of spinning vortices which is one of the effects of his third rule. Those vortices are caused by the invisible aether which are now seen in spiral galaxies which rotate. 

That causal aether manifests nowadays as the "Higgs field" which has two energy states, just as Descartes' aether has two kinds as to create the vortex. 

This is similar to how a typhoon's vortex is created from cold and warm air coming into contact with each other. More warm air leads to a stronger typhoon-vortex. Likewise, more high-energy aether leads to a more spiral galaxy and brighter stars.  

The 1919 eclipse would then solve the dark matter of Fritz Zwicky and Vera Rubin in advance, as well as dark energy from the expansion of spacetime as the repulsion of galaxies. 

Accrording to Descartes' theory, it is possible to move faster than light (as teleportation) without needing infinite amounts of energy, and to defy gravity by knowing how the aether works. 

Hindu and Buddhist monks already know the aether and so they can levitate themselves without using physical force. The ancient Egyptians also knew how to reduce gravity as to make pyramid blocks lighter for easier construction without modern machines. These are consistent with Descartes but not Newton who was totally ignorant of the aether.
